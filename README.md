# maestro

Simple processes manager

## Features

- Running processes under different users
- The correct order to start and stop processes
- 3 types of process readiness probe: `delay`, `HTTP` and `command`
- Ability to specify a stop signal separately for each process
- Redirecting of stdout and stderr
- Simple YAML configuration

## Configuration

The configuration file `maestro.yml` must be placed either in the current working directory or in `/etc/maestro`.
The configuration file must be a valid YAML document.

## Known issues

- Signals generated by keyboard interrupts (like Ctrl+C) are sent to every process in the foreground [process group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_group) of the current session. Therefore `maestro` cannot guarantee the correct order to stop apps when using signals generated by keyboard.
